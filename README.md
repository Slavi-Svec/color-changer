this is a app i made using HTML/CSS/JS. The button is pressed and the background colour is randomly changed.

First i made a button in HTML and styled in in CSS adding a cursor and hover to turn the button purple
when the cursor hovered over it. Next made the three constants in JS and made an array that included a list of colours. The next process was i added and event listener to the button with click. Finally using math random to cycle thru the array of background colours once the button is pushed. In addition to this i added the "funky button colour changer to the html to change the writing on the button.
this was a simple project to make but it helped me to better understand the use of the add event listener feature to a button and also using math random
